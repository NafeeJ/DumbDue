# DumbDue
A dumber version of Due for iOS, for Android.

Built with Kotlin using ViewModels, Navigation, Room, LiveData, and Databinding from Architecture Components and Dagger 2 for very basic Dependency Injection (will move to Hilt eventually or maybe never).

Development has been put on hold (maybe forever idk).
